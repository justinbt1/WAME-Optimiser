# WAME Optimizer
Implementation of the WAME optimization algorithm as described in the paper [Training Convolutional Networks with Weight-wise Adaptive Learning Rates](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2017-50.pdf) by Mosca and Magoulas. Implemented as an [optimizer class](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers) for TensorFlow 2.0 or higher.
